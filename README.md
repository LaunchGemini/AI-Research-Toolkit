A curated list of vital resources about artificial intelligence, spanning various domains like Computer Vision(CV), Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Recommendation Systems (Recsys), etc. This repository aims to provide some brief summaries on the selection of the pertinent research papers (CV, NLP, Recsys, and so on).

**Note:** The initial documentation of this project was in Chinese, but rest assured, we are working on translating it to English to make it approachable for a wider audience. However, we'd appreciate if you can interact with this repository in English.

Also, we do our best to keep the links updated. If you find any dead links or have any suggestions to improve, feel free to raise an issue. Contributions are always welcome.
